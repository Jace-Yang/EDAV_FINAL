# Conclusion

1. Producing movie while wishing to earn much can be harder than we typically thought!

     Most of the movies (more than 95%) are not seen by most of people, and most of the movies are not making a lot of money.

2. Producers may need to find the balance between profit and quality of movies.

    Higher profitability is usually negatively correlated with ratings.
