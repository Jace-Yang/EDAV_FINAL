# Conclusion

## Results

1. Producing movie while wishing to earn much can be harder than we typically thought!

     Most of the movies (more than 95%) are not seen by most of people, and most of the movies are not making a lot of money.

2. Producers may need to find the balance between profit and quality of movies.

    Higher profitability is usually negatively correlated with ratings.
    
    
## Limitations

- Limitation of D3 part: we cannot see a very comprehensive analysis of movies by our animation but only comparison of box office between individual movies.

- Limitation of other parts: Also, we didn't find out clear indication of the box office of certain movie throughout all the years.
