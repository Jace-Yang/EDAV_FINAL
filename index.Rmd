# Introduction

While liking a film or not seems to be a very subjective matter, the commercial process of the film appears to generate a plethora of objective statistics, like box office, rating. Are these numbers behind the scenes link to the various factors that make a movie more successful than others?

This question piqued our interest. Meggie and I, 2 big fans about movies, will discuss these topics in this project!

- What specific features do movies with higher profitability have?

- What contributes to higher-rating films?

- Is commercial success (high profit and high box offices) positively correlated with high rating or a trade-off?

Hope you enjoy! ðŸ˜„
