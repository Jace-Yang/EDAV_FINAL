So we calculate 15 most common value among each colomns: Apparently, \\N, for example, is likely to be a tag for missing value. SIGN_of_MISSING &lt;- c(&#39;\\\\N&#39;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;[]&quot;, &quot; #N/A&quot;, &quot;#N/A&quot;) 4.2 Missing by columns and rows We first take a glance of the missingness. By colomns: ## tconst averageRating numVotes titleType primaryTitle ## 0 0 0 0 0 ## originalTitle isAdult startYear endYear runtimeMinutes ## 0 0 0 0 0 ## genres ## 0 7 colomns are complete. endYear and runtimeMinutes seem to be a severely missing columns. By rows: we pick the 50 most popularly voted pieces of work, and check their missingness: ## The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King ## 0 ## Django Unchained ## 0 ## Inglourious Basterds ## 0 ## Schindler&#39;s List ## 0 ## The Green Mile ## 0 ## Shutter Island ## 0 ## The Godfather: Part II ## 0 ## Léon: The Professional ## 0 ## American History X ## 0 ## Kill Bill: Vol. 1 ## 0 ## WALL·E ## 0 ## Avengers: Infinity War ## 0 ## Mad Max: Fury Road ## 0 ## Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark ## 0 ## Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens ## 0 ## Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 ## 0 ## The Intouchables ## 0 ## The Big Lebowski ## 0 ## The Grand Budapest Hotel ## 0 ## Amélie ## 0 ## Kill Bill: Vol. 2 ## 0 ## Silver Linings Playbook ## 0 ## Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ## 0 ## District 9 ## 0 ## Once Upon a Time...

To double check that: By rows &amp; colomns: Observations: Nothing but endYear is missing frequently. We can infer that: 1. The most popular works have relatively complete information available to public 2. Movies are being voted much more than TV series, since only TV series has endYear as an attribute. 4.3 Missing plot 4.4 Heatmap Observations: ggtile() may not work very well this time because most of the values in our dataset are discrete and non-numeric. 4.5 Missing by other attributes We have already seen from missing by column that only four of the attributes have missing values. Therefore, it may not be meaningful to compare the missing values by year, rating, or votes, etc. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
