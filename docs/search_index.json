Are these numbers behind the scenes link to the various factors that make a movie more successful than others? This question piqued our interest. Meggie and I, 2 big fans about movies, will discuss these topics in this project! What specific features do movies with higher profitability have? What contributes to higher-rating films? Is commercial success (high profit and high box offices) positively correlated with high rating or a trade-off? Hope you enjoy! üòÑ "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our main data source is obtained from https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/, a daily updated movie dataset collected by IMDB. They made these subsets of IMDb data available for access to customers for personal and non-commercial use, but didn‚Äôt reveal the way they collected. Compared to other options like TMDB Database API, the one in IMDB can be directly download, up-to-date, and follows standard database format with id to each person, movie, and even episode. This dataset contains massive information about 258k+ films: Basics: genres, runtimes, starting year, is for adult or not, language, region ¬∑¬∑¬∑ Crews: directors, writers ¬∑¬∑¬∑ Principal cast: category, role, characters as well as their birth year, profession ¬∑¬∑¬∑ Rating: average rating on IMDB, number of votes ¬∑¬∑¬∑ Other than that, we also use an external data sources numbers to combine commercial statistics of 6,000+ movies released to theaters: Budget: https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all Box office: https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/worldwide/all-movies/cumulative/all-time "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Input data file 3.2 Merge &amp; Preprocess Data 3.3 Create d3 data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation In this section, we will discuss how to merge multiple movie data. It can be tricky to merge data from multiple sources. Talk is cheap, click the view source button to see the code if you are interested! 3.1 Input data file basics contains following information for each movies: akas contains all alias for each movies: ratings contains IMDb rating and votes: principals contains principal cast/crew for each movies Budget contains rev/cost info 3.2 Merge &amp; Preprocess Data 3.2.1 Limit the scope At this report, we dive in the ‚Äúmovies‚Äù, and especially those with box office (go the thereter). But the original dataset contains all these 10 types: We only focus on movie and tvMovie (as some of them have box office, like High School Musical 3: Senior Year). And we will use them to map other data. Also, we delete movie start at 2022 or later. 3.2.2 Merge movie-wised data For basic and rating data, we can use the title id tconst to merge directly. But the for the budget data acquired from numbers, we need to map them by movie name and it‚Äôs alias. Is is a tedious process to locate the IDMB id(tconst) value of 6,196 movies in theaters : Safest way: use movie name and their year to find id use movies name + RealeaseYear in budget to map primary title + year from basics of IDMB. -&gt; ‚úîÔ∏è matches 4495 rows use movies name + RealeaseYear in budget to map original title + year from basics of IDMB. -&gt; ‚úîÔ∏è matches 137 rows use movies name(drop punctuation) + RealeaseYear in budget to map title(drop punctuation) + year from akas of IDMB. -&gt; ‚úîÔ∏è matches 410 rows Not the best way: only use its name, and for multiple movies that share a same name, only consider the oen with highest number of votes in IMDB. -&gt; ‚úîÔ∏è matches 1012 rows Last way: fuzzy matching name + year - like Star Wars Ep. VII: The Force Awakens with Star Wars: Episode VII -&gt; ‚úîÔ∏è matches 135 rows -&gt; ‚ö†Ô∏è Last 7 movies that can‚Äôt be matched to IMDB: consider its rev/cost data as missing. After a tedious clean, we get this data to map them to imdb database: Then, we need to understand how the NA is encoded in the dataset. So we calculate 15 most common value among each columns: Apparently, \\N, for example, is likely to be one kind of tag for missing value among: SIGN_of_MISSING &lt;- c(&#39;\\\\N&#39;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;[]&quot;, &quot; #N/A&quot;, &quot;#N/A&quot;) 3.2.3 Merge person-wised data At this part we merge pricinpals to the movies they are in, and calculate the weighted average rating for each actor, actress and director. 3.2.4 Merge Movie/genres-wised data Noted that the genres column is not a cleaned column. To preserve this 1-movie-to-multi-genres relation, we assign main genres, second genres and third genres based on reverse order of the popularity of genres to each movie. For example, if a movie is tagged with Crime, Action, and Adventure. We will label Crime (177m votes) as main genre, Adventure (250m votes) as second, and Action (306m votes) as third. create a one-to-many mapping table for each movie in order to analysis, e.g, aveage votes for each genres. 3.3 Create d3 data Lastly, we calculate the all-time best movies, the result is stored in data/processing/d3input.csv.

NA in endYear is especially frequent. One possible explanation is that only TV series have endYear as an attribute. And we can see from the plot that Top voted videos are more likely to be movies than TV series. 4.2 Missing plot 4.2.1 Missing pattern summary Then we draw the missing value plot we coded from the Problem Set 4. The most prevalent missing pattern is indeed the missing endYear, accounting for about 70% of the cases, which is driven by the fact that the endYear variable is missing in nearly all of the samples. In addition, runtimeMinutes and endYear are frequently absent simultaneously, whereas genres and startYear are missing in minor amounts. 4.2.2 Heatmap We generated a heatmap based on the 50 most-voted works. All of the missings are for endYear with True Detective as an exception because only TV series has an endYear. Compared with other popular films, True Detective has fewer number of votes, but a relatively high averageRating and runtimeMinutes. Long running time matches the nature of TV series. 4.3 Insight about why NA happens 4.3.1 Missing by Years We first take a look at the missing values of runtime and genres by each of their launching year. Since the number of new movies vary a lot by years, we take a look into the missing ratios rather than values. From the first figure, we can see that the number of works is increasing by years (except for 2020 because of COVID-19). From the following 2 graphs, we can see that the amount of missing data for runtimeMinutes and genres are quite volatile. For runtimeMinutes, the missing percentage was high before 1960 may be due to technology reasons (but the sample size is small), and there is an increasing trend after 1960. For genres, it begins to decrease after the year of 2000. We can infer that the film market became more standardized and the industry has been benefited by the growth of technology. 4.3.2 Missing by Genres Let take a deeper look at the missing values of runtime by each of their genre to see if there are some patterns here: We can see a significant difference between genres: Genres which are not usaully limited by run time, such as talk show and news, have the most missing runtimes as expected. On the contrary, films and noir nearly have no missing value in runtime, which are also as what we might be expecting.

Then this page will serve as a cookbook for you to make such decision! 5.1 Get Ready to Fail From a historical standpoint, we look a strong long tail effect on film industry, that is, minority make up to be majority. From the main graph, we see the peaks of the popularity (# of votes people give in IMDB) goes higher along with more and more movies are released seen in the bottom subgraph. However, the left graph shows a severe concentrating on movies with very low votes. Let dive in to see this ‚Äú80-20 rule‚Äù. Surprisingly, ‚Äú80-20 rule‚Äù is now: 80% movies receives 1.864% of votes given to them, and this number is more low for commericial statistics like box office. Why? Because most of the movies are rarely known to genreal public. For example, I asked several friends and none of them ever heard of Vice Squad, which receives 666 votes and this number is higher than 85% of the movies in the entire IMDb database. 5.2 Follow the Best Practices Despite this long tail effect, there are still movies that achieved both commercial success (high profit and high box offices), and high rating: These plots show the all time top 30 movies that generates highest box office. In the top right area (ROI &gt;= the median 6.74, Rating &gt;= the median 7.25), we can see The Lord of the Rings achieves 12 times return on investment while maintains a high rating close to 9. Avatar gets highest box office (2,845,899,541 dollars) in film history. 5.3 Choose the Genre 5.3.1 How genres make a difference? To begin, we can see that the various statistics of different genres are quite disparate. Dramas have the highest amount of films, with almost 3000 films. Sport is the most recent genre to emerge, with many genres having new works in the 1920s-1940s History, war, and other subjects have an average duration of more than 2 hours Documentary‚Äôs average ROI reached a maximum of 4.7, due to the relatively low cost of actors but highest fame, while Box office is higher Adventure and Action ROI in the vicinity of 3. Animation has both a high ROI as well as a high box office. 5.3.2 Genre affects profitability a lot In terms of box office, TOP 3 genres are Animation, Adventure, and Action, while the last 3 are Horror, Romance, and Drama. It consistent with our common sense. While all genres show a concentrating around low box office, movies in Actions seem to have a more flat transition into higher box office. Those above 2.5B ‚Äòoutliers‚Äô are in Adventure, Action, Fantasy and Drama. 5.3.3 But not that much difference in rating As the rating is weighted calculated for the all the votes of 1 movie, it looks kind of normally distributed around the mean. Biography, surprisingly, have a largest average rating. This might due to people like to give higher rating to esoteric movies, especially those they think they understand the hidden meaning. The group differences of genres are not less than box office. Biography have about 2 scores higher than the worst of 13 popular genres, the Horror movie. 5.4 Pick a good title Wordcloud for titles of all movies Wordcloud for titles of movies with &gt; 10,000,000 $ box office Although words like ‚Äúlove‚Äù, ‚Äústory‚Äù, etc are appearing in the most number of movies, there is no significant sigh of making more money with those words. 5.5 Build your crews Now, with a good script for your selected genres, you want to find the proper directors and actors to make the film happen. 5.5.1 Who makes those best movies 5.5.2 Rating &amp; ROI vs.¬†Interaction Between Actors and Directors For most of the actors and directors that collaborate, profitabilities are not clearly correlated with ratings (except for Chris Evans!) 5.6 Understand how ratings work It‚Äôs natural to have a rating below 9 scores for popular movies. Ratings goes done when more classes of people rates the movies. It‚Äôs really hard for a popular movie to serve everyone‚Äôs preference. We can see that as the number of votes increases, there seems to be an invisible boundary that prevent them from being rate highly. On the contrary, all the movies with extremely high ratings have very few number of votes. Therefore, producers should find a balance between popularities and ratings.

Possible reasons can be: Technology has improved the sense of immersion when watching movie, making the genre of Adventure more popular; Technology has made adventure and action movies more feasible; People now are looking for excitement more often than in the past; etc. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Results 7.2 Limitations", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Results Producing movie while wishing to earn much can be harder than we typically thought! Most of the movies (more than 95%) are not seen by most of people, and most of the movies are not making a lot of money. Producers may need to find the balance between profit and quality of movies. Higher profitability is usually negatively correlated with ratings. 7.2 Limitations Limitation of D3 part: we cannot see a very comprehensive analysis of movies by our animation but only comparison of box office between individual movies.
