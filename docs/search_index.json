So we have raised the following questions. What specific features do movies with higher profitability have? What contributes to higher-rating films? Is commercial success (high profit and high box offices) positively correlated with high rating or a trade-off? 5.1 What specific features do movies with higher profitability have? First, we can use the budget data provided by the-numbers to estimate the cost, and then combine it with box offices to calculate the revenue of each movie. Through IMDB’s main data, we can analyze the genres of movies, popularity of the star/director/screenwriter, or the runtime of movies that can bring high profits. 5.2 What contributes to higher-rating films? 5.2.1 shit bro In addition to using the same data as the first question, we can also use review data provided by Stanford to discover how people think when lots of people give high scores to a movie. ## [1] &quot;A Lawless Street&quot; It’s not supprising to find out that over 90% of the movies do not have votes over 500. We consider 1000 as a threshold to determine the movie is at least not unknown to the general public. For example, I asked several friends and none of them ever heard of The Golden Chance, which receives 227 votes and this number is higher than 85% of the movies in the entire imdb database. ## # A tibble: 1,195,712 × 11 ## tconst averageRating numVotes titleType primaryTitle originalTitle isAdult ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 tt0111161 9.3 2488195 movie The Shawsha… The Shawshan… 0 ## 2 tt0468569 9 2441388 movie The Dark Kn… The Dark Kni… 0 ## 3 tt1375666 8.8 2190799 movie Inception Inception 0 ## 4 tt0137523 8.8 1959929 movie Fight Club Fight Club 0 ## 5 tt0110912 8.9 1924045 movie Pulp Fiction Pulp Fiction 0 ## 6 tt0109830 8.8 1922897 movie Forrest Gump Forrest Gump 0 ## 7 tt0944947 9.2 1899202 tvSeries Game of Thr… Game of Thro… 0 ## 8 tt0133093 8.7 1776732 movie The Matrix The Matrix 0 ## 9 tt0120737 8.8 1743718 movie The Lord of… The Lord of … 0 ## 10 tt0167260 8.9 1722424 movie The Lord of… The Lord of … 0 ## # … with 1,195,702 more rows, and 4 more variables: startYear &lt;chr&gt;, ## # endYear &lt;chr&gt;, runtimeMinutes &lt;chr&gt;, genres &lt;chr&gt; Also, there might be some relationship between the rating volume and rating in IMDB’s scoring system. 5.3 Is commercial success (high profit and high box offices) positively correlated with high rating or a trade-off? A scatter plot with lm lines of box office versus ratings, for example, can reveal their relationship. A matrix can also be drawn to filter those outliers in the first and fourth quadrant (high box office but low score, or high score but low box office). We can extract keywords from their review, generate word cloud plots to analyze their characteristics.
