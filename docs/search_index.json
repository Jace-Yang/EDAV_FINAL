So we calculate 15 most common value among each columns: Apparently, \\N, for example, is likely to be one kind of tag for missing value among: SIGN_of_MISSING &lt;- c(&#39;\\\\N&#39;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;[]&quot;, &quot; #N/A&quot;, &quot;#N/A&quot;) 4.2 Missing glance We first take a glance of the missingness. By columns: ## endYear runtimeMinutes genres startYear tconst ## 1160866 328255 19801 197 0 ## averageRating numVotes titleType primaryTitle originalTitle ## 0 0 0 0 0 ## isAdult ## 0 7 columns are complete. endYear and runtimeMinutes seem to be a severely missing columns. ## The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King ## 1 ## Django Unchained ## 1 ## Inglourious Basterds ## 1 ## Schindler&#39;s List ## 1 ## The Green Mile ## 1 ## Shutter Island ## 1 ## The Godfather: Part II ## 1 ## Léon: The Professional ## 1 ## American History X ## 1 ## Kill Bill: Vol. 1 ## 1 ## WALL·E ## 1 ## Avengers: Infinity War ## 1 ## Mad Max: Fury Road ## 1 ## Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark ## 1 ## Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens ## 1 ## Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 ## 1 ## The Intouchables ## 1 ## The Big Lebowski ## 1 ## The Grand Budapest Hotel ## 1 ## Amélie ## 1 ## Kill Bill: Vol. 2 ## 1 ## Silver Linings Playbook ## 1 ## Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ## 1 ## District 9 ## 1 ## Once Upon a Time...

NA in endYear is especially frequent. One possible explanation is that only TV series have endYear as an attribute. And we can see from the plot that Top voted videos are more likely to be movies than TV series. 4.3 Missing plot 4.3.1 Missing pattern summary Then we draw the missing value plot we coded from the PSet 4. The most prevalent missing pattern is indeed the missing endYear, accounting for about 70% of the cases, which is driven by the fact that the endYear variable is missing in nearly all of the samples. In addition, runtimeMinutes and endYear are frequently absent simultaneously, whereas genres and startYear are missing in minor amounts. 4.3.2 Heatmap We generated a heatmap based on the 50 most-voted works. All of the missings are for endYear with True Detective as an exception because only TV series has an endYear. Compared with other popular films, True Detective has fewer number of votes, but a relatively high averageRating and runtimeMinutes. Long running time matches the nature of TV series. 4.4 Insight about why NA happens 4.4.1 Missing by Years We first take a look at the missing values of runtime and genres by each of their launching year. Since the number of new movies vary a lot by years, we take a look into the missing ratios rather than values. From the first figure, we can see that the number of works is increasing by years (except for 2020 because of COVID-19). From the following 2 graphs, we can see that the amount of missing data for runtimeMinutes and genres are quite volatile. For runtimeMinutes, the missing percentage was high before 1960 may be due to technology reasons (but the sample size is small), and there is an increasing trend after 1960. For genres, it begins to decrease after the year of 2000. We can infer that the film market became more standardized and the industry has been benefited by the growth of technology. 4.4.2 Missing by Genres Let take a deeper look at the missing values of runtime by each of their genre to see if there are some patterns here: We can see a significant difference between genres: Genres which are not usaully limited by run time, such as talk show and news, have the most missing runtimes as expected. On the contrary, films and noir nearly have no missing value in runtime, which are also as what we might be expecting.
