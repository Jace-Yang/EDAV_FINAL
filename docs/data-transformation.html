<li><p>For basic and rating data, we can use the title id <code>tconst</code> to merge directly.</p></li>
<li><p>But the for the <code>budget</code> data acquired from <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all/1">numbers</a>, we need to map them by movie name and it’s alias. Is is a tedious process to locate the IDMB id(<code>tconst</code>) value of 6,196 movies in theaters :</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Safest way: use movie name and their year to find id</p>
<ul>
<li><p>use <code>movies name</code> + <code>RealeaseYear</code> in budget to map <code>primary title</code> + <code>year</code> from <code>basics</code> of IDMB. -&gt; ✔️ matches 4495 rows</p></li>
<li><p>use <code>movies name</code> + <code>RealeaseYear</code> in budget to map <code>original title</code> + <code>year</code> from <code>basics</code> of IDMB. -&gt; ✔️ matches 137 rows</p></li>
<li><p>use <code>movies name</code>(drop punctuation) + <code>RealeaseYear</code> in budget to map <code>title</code>(drop punctuation) + <code>year</code> from <code>akas</code> of IDMB. -&gt; ✔️ matches 410 rows</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Not the best way: only use its name, and for multiple movies that share a same name, only consider the oen with highest number of votes in IMDB. -&gt; ✔️ matches 1012 rows</p></li>
<li><p>Last way: fuzzy matching name + year - like Star Wars Ep. VII: The Force Awakens with Star Wars: Episode VII -&gt; ✔️ matches 135 rows</p></li>
<li><p>-&gt; ⚠️ Last 7 movies that can’t be matched to IMDB: consider its rev/cost data as missing.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>After a tedious clean, we get this data to map them to imdb database:</p>
